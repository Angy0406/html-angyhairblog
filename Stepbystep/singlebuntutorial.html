                <i>
                    Refresh and detangle hair. Begin on clean hair that is dry
                    and detangled. If needed, refresh your hair with a dry
                    shampoo. <br />
                    Brush your hair to gently remove any knots, then use a
                    styling oil to add shine and prevent frizz. <br />
                    This will ensure that your hair is smooth and ready for your
                    gorgeous new braids in a bun style.

                <i>
                    Create a high ponytail. <br />
                    Pull your hair up into a high ponytail and secure it in
                    place with a hair tie. The center of your crown is an ideal
                    position.

                <i>

                    you will start creating your braids into a bun.

                <b>STEP 4</b> <br />
                <i>
                    Complete your braid. Braid your hair all the way to the end
                    of your ponytail and secure it with a clear elastic hair
                    tie. <br />
                    You can braid your hair as tight or as loose as you want,
                    itâ€™s totally up to you!

                <b>STEP 5 </b> <br />
                <i>
                    Wrap your braid into a bun. Take the end of your braid and
                    wrap it around the base of your ponytail to create your
                    braided bun. <br />
                    You can use the opposite hand to hold the base of your braid
                    in place as you coil the hair around.

                <b>STEP 6</b> <br />
                <i>
                    Secure your bun. To ensure that your braided bun stays put,
                    insert bobby pins into your bun. <br />
                    Place as many as needed around your bun. You might need more
                    pins if you have thick or curly hair.

                    and now have a chic yet simple look. <br />
                    Make sure that you spray your hair some hairspray to ensure
                    that your braided bun style stays in place all day long.
